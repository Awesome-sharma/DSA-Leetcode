# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.
# Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.
# Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 

# Example 1:
# Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

# Example 2:
# Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if k == 0: return 0
        dp = [[1000, 0] for _ in range(k + 1)]
        for price in prices:
            for i in range(1, k + 1):
                dp[i][0] = min(dp[i][0], price - dp[i - 1][1])
                dp[i][1] = max(dp[i][1], price - dp[i][0])
        return dp[k][1]
